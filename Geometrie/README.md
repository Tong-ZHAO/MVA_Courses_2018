# Géométrie et espaces de formes

* **Professor**: Teached by [Alain Trouvé](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=dH1oDusAAAAJ&hl=en) (ENS de Cachan) and [Joan Alexis Glaunès](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=vUfUpd0AAAAJ) (Université Paris Descartes).

* **Language**: The course is taught in French.

## Objective

This course aims to propose an introductory exhibition from a geometric point of view on the deformable models which consists in building Riemannian metrics on spaces of objects (n-tuples of points, curves, binary regions, surfaces, field of tensors, grayscale images, measurements, etc.) considered as finite or infinite manifolds from the study of natural infinitesimal deformations acting on these objects.

## Validation

The course is validated by a personal project, 6 theoritical homeworks and 3 TPs.

We are expected to do all the exercises in the textbook once the professor finishes a chapter.

The TP sessions are well-organised, which show how to apply pure mathematics into real applications.

A project is chosen before the last session and a presentation of 45 minutes is scheduled in one month. We focus only on the theoritical aspects.

## My Project

I worked on the paper: [Diffeomorphic 3D Image Registration via Geodesic Shooting Using an Efficient Adjoint Calculation](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11263-011-0481-8).
