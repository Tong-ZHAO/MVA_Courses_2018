# Approches géométriques en apprentissage statistique - l’exemple des données longitudinales

* **Professor**: Teached by [Stanley Durrleman](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=-K2XrGUAAAAJ&hl=en) (INRIA). 

* **Language**: The course is taught in French. 

## Objective

Longitudinal data, sometimes referred to as panel data, track the same sample at different points in time, which raises the problem of the definition of statistical distribution of trajectories. Differential geometry is a powerful tool to deal with this issue. The objective of this course is to introduce differential geometry (especially Riemannian geometry) and apply them in many interesting examples. 

## Validation

The course is validated by a personal project. Depending on the choice of paper, a theoritical or numerical analysis is expected. A presentation is scheduled after the last lesson. No report is required.

## My Project

I worked on the paper: [Learning low-dimensional representations of shape data sets with diffeomorphic autoencoders](https://hal.inria.fr/hal-01963736/document). It is a deep learning based method which intends to solve diffeomorphism problem using a variational autoencoder.
