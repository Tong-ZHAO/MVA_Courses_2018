* **Language**: The course is taught in English.

## Objective

This course emphasizes the gap between theory and practice, explaining common theoretical misconceptions, and comparing the performance of neural networks vs. classical machine learning techniques on explicit cases. It gives a large review of recent architectures paradigms and modern methods. Each lecture is illustrated either with invited speakers from famous companies or through a practical lab session.

## Validation

The course is validated by 3 mini-projects.

* H1: GAN and VAE
* H2: Image Retrieval
* H3: Small data and deep learning
