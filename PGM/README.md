* **Language**: The course is taught in English.

## Objective

This course provides a unifying introduction to probabilistic modelling through the framework of graphical models, together with their associated learning and inference algorithms.

## Validation

The course is validated by 3 homeworks (50%) and a final exam (50%).

The homeworks focus on:

* H1: Linear discriminant analysis and Quadratic discriminant analysis
* H2: Gaussian mixture model
* H3: Hidden markov model
