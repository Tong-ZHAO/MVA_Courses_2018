# Deformable models and geodesic methods for image analysis

* **Professor**: Teached by [Laurent COHEN](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=lphQnvMAAAAJ) (Universit√© Paris Dauphine).

* **Website**: [Here](https://www.ceremade.dauphine.fr/~cohen/index.php?article7/cours-master-2-mva-geodesic-methods-and-deformable-models)

* **Language**: The course is taught in French.

## Objective

The course gives a large overview of methods and algorithms of deformable models for image segmentation, illustrated by concrete applications. Most of the methods are based on partial differential equations and finite element methods.

## Validation

The course is validated by a project and a 10-minute multi-choice exam. 3 TP sessions are arranged and they are not evaluated in the final grade.

The project can be done personally or in a group of 2 students. A numerical implementation is mandatory and a report (max 10 pages) is expected before the final presentation. The presentation lasts 20 minutes, including a Q&A session of 5 minutes.

The attendence of the multi-choice exam is mandatory while the score is considered as bonus in the final grade.

## My Project

With Xiaoqi X., we worked on the paper: [Beyond the Pixel-Wise Loss for Topology-Aware Delineation](http://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2018/papers/Mosinska_Beyond_the_Pixel-Wise_CVPR_2018_paper.pdf). The author proposed a U-Net based autoencoder to recover the curvilinear structures on images. The report and the slide can be found in the folder **project**. We implemented their method in PyTorch and our codes can be found [here](https://github.com/Tong-ZHAO/topology_aware_delineation).
