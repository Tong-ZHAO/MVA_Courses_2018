* **Language**: The course is taught in French.

## Objective

This course gives an overview of the concepts and techniques of acquisition, processing and visualization of 3D point clouds, and their mathematical and algorithmic foundations. It addresses in particular the following topics:

* 3D perception systems
* Operations
* Registration
* Point cloud segmentation
* Curve and surface reconstruction
* Primitive modeling
* Rendering

There are 6 classes and each consists of a theoritical session and a TP session.

## Validation

The course is validated by a personal project (50%) and 6 TPs (50%).

The project is evaluated by a report, which needs to be submitted one week before the seminar, and an oral presentation.

The TPs are required to be submitted one week after the annoucement. They focus on the following algorithms:

* H1: Basic Operations and Structures on Point Clouds
* H2: ICP Algorithm for Point Cloud Registration
* H3: Rendering
* H4: Neighborhood Descriptors
* H5: Surface Reconstruction
* H6: Modelling

## My Project

I worked on the paper: [Symmetry and Orbit Detection via Lie-Algebra Voting](http://www.geometry.caltech.edu/pubs/SADBH16.pdf). It proposed a novel method to find both local and global symmetries and orbits in a point cloud. I implemented the algorithms in Python for 2D images and in C++ for 3D images. My code can be found [here](https://github.com/Tong-ZHAO/Symmetry_orbit_detection).
