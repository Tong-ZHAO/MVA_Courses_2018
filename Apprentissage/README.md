# Apprentissage par Réseaux de Neurones Profonds

Teached by [Stéphane Mallat](https://scholar.google.fr/citations?user=g_YTmSgAAAAJ&hl=en) (ENS Ulm). More details and recorded videos can be found [here](https://www.college-de-france.fr/site/stephane-mallat/course-2018-2019.htm).

## Objective

Neural networks become more and more popular and it has been applied successfully in many fields in spite of the lack of theoretical guides. The purpose of this course is trying to explaine neural networks using algorithmic and mathematical tools. It is open to public and one speaker is invited to give a talk during each session. 

## Validation

The course is validated by a data challenge on the [plateform](https://challengedata.ens.fr), which is quite similar to Kaggle plateform. We are free to choose one among all proposed challenges on various tasks, including computer vision, medical analyse, natural language processing, sequential data, etc.. We can work on it in a group up to 2 persons. A report is expected before the oral presentation. 

## My Project

I worked on the challenge: [Spatiotemporal PM10 concentration prediction by Plume Labs](https://challengedata.ens.fr/participants/challenges/7/ranking/public) with Pierre O. during two months. We ranked the 1st on both the public leaderboard and the academic leaderboard when we passed our presentation. Since we decided to continue working on it until the end, all sources(e.g. codes, slides and reports) will be uploaded after the end of the challenge on the 1st Jan 2020.
