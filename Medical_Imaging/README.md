# Statistical computing on manifolds and data assimilation

* **Professor**: Teached by [Herv√© Delingette](https://scholar.google.fr/citations?user=7xnkHM0AAAAJ&hl=en) and [Xavier Pennec](https://scholar.google.fr/citations?hl=en&user=mjFyf2wAAAAJ) (INRIA Sophia-Antipolis).

* **Language**: The course is taught in French.

## Objective

The course focuses on advanced statistical and mechanical modeling techniques for computational anatomy and physiology. They detail the foundations of statistical and mechanical modeling and they show how these models can be coupled with observations (medical images). The long term goal of this type of techniques is to arrive to a personalized in-silico medicine.

## Validation

The course is validated by a project (report 25%, presentation 25%, Q&A 25%) and a 30-minute multi-choice exam (25%).

The project can be done individually or in a group of two students. A report is expected before the presentation and all student projects will be presented at the last class.

## My Challenge

I worked on the paper: [A Riemannian Statistical Shape Model using Differential Coordinates](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/4bb0/7d4eaa9425b79db3d727f6b2d00f8f66912c.pdf?_ga=2.250506114.506878784.1557396106-1358984737.1535240750). It proposed an efficient method to estimate statistical properties of shapes.
