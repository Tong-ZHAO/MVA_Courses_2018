# Reinforcement learning

* **Professor**: Teached by [Alessandro Lazaric](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=6JZ3R6wAAAAJ&hl=en) (FAIR).

* **Language**: The course is taught in English.

## Objective

It gives an introduction to the models and mathematical tools used in formalizing the problem of learning and decision-making under uncertainty. In particular, the frameworks of reinforcement learning and multi-arm bandit are detailed.

## Validation

The course is validated by a project (85%) and 3 TPs (15%).

The project can be done individually or in a group of 2 students. Based on the choice of the paper, a literaure review or a numerical analysis is required. A report (max 10 pages) has to be submitted before the presentation.

The TPs focus on the following algorithms:

* H1: Dynamic Programming and Reinforcement Learning
* H2: The Exploration-Exploitation Dilemma
* H3: Reinforcement Learning with Function Approximation

## My Project

With Haozhe S., we worked on the paper: [Mastering the game of Go without human knowledge](https://deepmind.com/blog/alphago-zero-learning-scratch/). Inspired by AlphaGo Zero, we implemented the algorithm from scratch on Python and then applied it on English Checkers, a famous strategy board games for two players. A GUI is provided to let users playing with the trained model. The codes can be found [here](https://github.com/Tong-ZHAO/AlphaDraughts-Zero).
