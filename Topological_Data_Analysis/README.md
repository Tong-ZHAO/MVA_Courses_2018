# Topological Data Analysis

* **Professor**: Teached by [Frédéric Chazal](https://scholar.google.fr/citations?user=OVl2-30AAAAJ&hl=en) (INRIA) and [Julien Tierny](https://scholar.google.fr/citations?hl=en&user=Wjw0dTUAAAAJ) (CNRS).

* **Website**: [here](https://www-apr.lip6.fr/~tierny/topologicalDataAnalysisClass.html)

* **Language**: The course is taught in French.

## Objective

The purpose of this course is to introduce the main concepts of the recent field of Topological Data Analysis and illustrate their use in imaging (scientific visualization) and machine learning applications, both from a mathematical and practical point of view.

## Validation

The course is validated by a project and a 30-minute Written Exam.

The project can be done individually or in a group of 2 students. The paper is presented in the last class.

## My Project

With Darius A., we worked on the paper: [Robust and Fast Extraction of 3D Symmetric Tensor Field Topology](http://web.engr.oregonstate.edu/~zhange/images/3DTensorTopology_Detection.pdf). They proposed a method to detect degenerate points and neutral surfaces given a 3D symmetric tensor field.
