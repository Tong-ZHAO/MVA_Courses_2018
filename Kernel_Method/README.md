# Kernel methods for machine learning

* **Professor**: Teached by [Julien Mairal](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Bx9WGD6lBFEC&hl=en) (INRIA) and [Jean-Philippe Vert](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=pqpxh7IAAAAJ) (Mines ParisTech).

* **Language**: The course is taught in English.

## Objective

The goal of this course is to present the mathematical foundations of kernel methods, as well as the main approaches that have emerged so far in kernel design. A presentation of the theory of positive definite kernels and reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces are introduced. With these notions, various kernel algorithms are mentioned and various kernels are detailed.

## Validation

The course is validated by a writting homework (20%), a final exam (40%) and a challenge on Kaggle (40%). 

The challenge can be finished in a group up to 3 students and a 2-page report is required after the challenge.

## My Challenge

[Here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/kernel-methods-for-machine-learning-2018-2019) is the challenge page for the academic year 2018-2019. The goal of the data challenge is to perform a sequence classification task - predicting whether a DNA sequence region is binding site to a specific transcription factor - with kernel methods. We ranked 2nd on the final leaderboard and our codes can be found in the folder **mini_challenge**.
