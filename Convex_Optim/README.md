* **Language**: The course is taught in English. 

## Objective

The objective of this course is to learn to recognize, transform and solve a broad class of convex optimization problems arising in various fields such as machine learning, finance or signal processing. The course starts with a basic primer on convex analysis followed by a quick overview of convex duality theory. The second half of the course is focused on algorithms, including first-order and interior point methods, together with bounds on their complexity. The course ends with illustrations of these techniques in various applications.

## Validation

The course is validated by 3 homeworks (2 writting homeworks and 1 programming homework), which counts for 40% of the overall grade, and a final exam, which counts for  60% of the overall grade. 

## My Homeworks

My homeworks can be found in the folder **DM** and our textbook can be found in the folder **poly**.
