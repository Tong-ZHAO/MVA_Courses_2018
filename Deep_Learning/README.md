## Objective

With the increase of computational power and amounts of available data, but also with the development of novel training algorithms and new whole approaches, many breakthroughs occurred over the few last years in Deep Learning for object and spoken language recognition, text generation, and robotics. This class covers the fundamental aspects and the recent developments in deep learning in various domains.

## Validation

The course is validated by 3 mini-projects.

* H1: Image Classification and Regression
* H2: Nature Language Processing
* H3: Deep Reinforcement Learning
