# Introduction à l'imagerie numérique

* **Professor**: Teached by [Julie Delon](https://scholar.google.fr/citations?user=X6MBHUUAAAAJ&hl=en) (Université Paris Descartes) and [Yann Gousseau](https://scholar.google.fr/citations?hl=en&user=iIUyg0gAAAAJ) (Télécom ParisTech).

* **Language**: The course is taught in French.

## Objective

The course introduces the main principles of the formation and acquisition of digital images (sensors, sampling, quantification, dynamics, noise), and the main ingredients of the image structure (radiometry, color, geometry, texture, artifacts of acquisition). It gives a knowledge of the most classic tools of the improvement or the analysis of the images. Various mathematical tools are illustrated by examples of applications from the fields of consumer digital photography, medical imaging or aerial imagery.

## Validation

The course is validated by a project. It can be done individually or in a group of 2 students. A numerical implementation and a report are mandatory. Even if the project is done in group, the presentation is scheduled individually.

## My Project

With Clément R., we worked on the paper: [Fast Bilateral Solver](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1511.03296.pdf). It introduces a novel algorithm for edge-aware smoothing that combines the flexibility and speed of simple filtering approaches with the accuracy of domain-specific optimization algorithms. We implemented the algorithm in Python and applied it into different applications: stereo and colorization. Our codes can be found [here](https://github.com/Tong-ZHAO/Fast-Bilateral-Filter).
