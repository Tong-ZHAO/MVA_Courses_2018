# Sub-pixel image processing

* **Professor**: Teached by [Lionel Moisan](https://scholar.google.fr/citations?user=Ez0owPcAAAAJ&hl=en) (Universit√© Paris Descartes).

* **Language**: The course is taught in French.

## Objective

The problematic of the transition from continuous to discrete (numerical implementation of mathematical principles) and that of the transition from discrete to continuous (extraction of sub-pixel information from a digital image) are of great importance in mathematical image processing. The objective of this course is to tackle these questions by going from classical results (Shannon sampling theory, consistency of diagrams to finite differences, ...) up to the most recent notions, highlighting in reviewing some problems still open now. 

Each class consists of a theoritical session and a TP session which will illustrates the theorems seen in class and raise theoretical questions based on concrete observations.

## Validation

The course is validated by a personal project / an oral exam (60%) and 6 TPs (40%).

Two types of projects are proposed: either a project on paper or an open project which does not necessarily has a good solution till now. A presentation is scheduled at the end.

The TPs focus on the following algorithms:

* H1: Diffraction by a circular aperture
* H2: Sampling and Spectral Interpolation
* H3: Fourier Transformation
* H4: Periodical Decomposition and Smooth
* H5: Interpolation, Translation et Diffraction
* H6: Zoom

## My Project

I worked on the project: sub-pixel Canny curve extraction by geometric methods. It is not yet finished and more details will be released in July.
